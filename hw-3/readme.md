* It is nice to begin dipping into p5.  I have a fair amount of experience reading code and have done "Hello World"s in many of them. and agree that it is a kind of rite of passage.  This assignment was fairly easy to undertake but seeing the changes in real time using the Preview HTML package for Atom was fun.  Here's a screenshot of that package in action: ![Preview in Action](./images/htmlpreview.jpg)

* Since I had already taken WebDev, I knew of the importance of our friend index.html and I'm already thinking of ways to combine what I learned in that class with what we are going to be learning here.  I didn't have any issues and found the presented links and videos concise.

* I'm currently waiting for issues to come in that I can assist with and have already had the pleasure of helping two classmates with the previous week's assignment.
