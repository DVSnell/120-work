[I.D.I.O.T. : Interplanetary Debris Interdiction and Observation Taskforce](https://dvsnell.github.io/120-work/Final-Project/)

*So this was a whole thing.  I enjoyed the project as I really stretched my coding and utilized some creative implementation to get it all into shape.  Problems?  Well, that array that performed perfectly except for the spawning of tens of thousands of elements off screen.  Thanks to Professor Musick for helping chase that one down.  The "sound design" for this project was also fun.  Ice cream scoops make great processed blaster sounds.

*Due to some personal issues I started actually coding quite late on this project.  This also meant I wasn't able to help out in the issues forum which is a real bummer since there was so much interaction there for this project.


### Final Project Proposal (UPDATED)

#### Intent:
I plan to create a game where the player, controlling a spaceship, must avoid/destroy asteroids while progressing to a planet.

The Minimal Viable Product will have:
* ~~A controllable ship that can collide with and be destroyed by the asteroids.~~ (COMPLETE 12/08)
* ~~Fireable weapons that, when colliding with asteroids destroys them.~~ (COMPLETE 12/08)
* ~~A moving background.~~ (COMPLETE 12/08)
* ~~Background music.~~ (COMPLETE 12/11)
* ~~Progress to destination tracker.~~ Merged with Score counter. (COMPLETE 12/09)

Possible feature creep includes:
* ~~Sound effects.~~ (COMPLETE 12/11)
* Power ups.
* Controls beyond left/right/up/down/shoot.
* ~~Score counter.~~ (COMPLETE 12/09)
* Enemies that shoot at the player.

Shoot for the moon idea:
* First person mode???

#### Inspiration:
For inspiration I'm looking to the scrolling shooter games of the past such as *Gradius*, *Xevious*, *Tyrian*, and *Raptor*.

I remember spending countless hours watching my father play *Xevious* and *Gradius* on the FamiCom and occasionally got to play myself.  The works of Namco and their competitors shaped much of my childhood, so I look to them for the core inspiration.  As I got older and started PC gaming, I was excited to see that the scrolling shooter genre had progressed and enjoyed playing *Tyrian* and *Raptor*.

I'm also looking to Philip Price's *The Tail of Beta Lyrae* since it is one of the first games I played that had randomly generated elements to add replayability and difficulty to a game.

#### Difficulties:
I see two major difficulties for me.

The first is "gamey-ness".  I need to make essentially three different draw loops: The start screen, the game screen, and the game over screen(s).  I need to make sure the triggers are rock solid as well. (COMPLETE 12/11)

The other major difficulty is how to handle multiple interactions.  Should the asteroids interact with each other?  Should they break up into smaller pieces when destroyed?  I'm not sure which path I'll take yet.

I also know I need to figure out a way to control difficulty based on time or even number of plays done which is a behind-the-scenes number crunching interaction. (MODIFIED/COMPLETE 12/10)

#### Time Line:
* Thanksgiving break - Come up with the initial idea
* 11/26 - Conceptual planning
* 11/27 - Artistic planning
* 11/28 - Write the planning readme.md ;)
* 11/30 to 12/01 - File structuring, server set up, and asset creation.
* 12/03 to 12/07 - Code like a fiend.  Test as I go.  Break things.  Get frustrated.  Sulk/Brain storm.  Fix things.
* 12/08 to 12/10 - The madness goes deep and I try to implement the "first person mode" version.
* Evening of 12/10 - Submit the final project.

#### Completed Work
For completed work, I have decided on the general idea detailed in this document and on the artistic styling I want to use.  I've also pinned down which files I will need to include in my final project.  Other than that, I'm going to be starting relatively fresh.
